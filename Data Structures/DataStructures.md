## Data Structures and Algorithms
- **Abdul Bari's YouTube Channel:** For comprehensive explanations of Data Structures and Algorithms, particularly in C/C++, Abdul Bari's channel is an invaluable resource. His clear and concise teaching style makes complex topics easy to understand.
- **Striver's SDE Sheet:** A highly recommended resource for interview preparation, Striver's SDE Sheet provides a curated list of essential Data Structures and Algorithms problems. It's a structured approach to mastering common interview questions.
- **SDE Sheets (General):** Beyond Striver's sheet, many other SDE (Software Development Engineer) sheets exist, often compiled by experienced engineers, offering a variety of problems and approaches to learning.
