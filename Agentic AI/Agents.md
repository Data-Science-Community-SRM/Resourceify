# Agentic AI Development Guide

This guide provides resources and a learning path for developing Agentic AI applications. Agentic AI focuses on creating systems that can autonomously perceive, reason, plan, and act in complex environments.

## Key Frameworks and Libraries

* **LangChain:** A framework for developing applications powered by language models. It enables chaining together different components (prompts, models, tools) to create complex workflows.
    * [LangChain Documentation](https://python.langchain.com/docs/get_started/introduction)
    * [LangChain YouTube Channel](http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLsWvCm_6AaLFLYM68UISzDQ2bVV1-qHAF)
* **LangGraph:** Designed to build stateful, multi-actor applications with LLMs, by modeling LLM applications as graphs.
    * [LangGraph Documentation](https://python.langchain.com/docs/langgraph)
* **CrewAI:** Framework for orchestrating role-playing, autonomous AI agents. By fostering collaborative intelligence, CrewAI empowers developers to create sophisticated applications where agents assume distinct roles, share insights, and operate cohesively to achieve shared objectives.
